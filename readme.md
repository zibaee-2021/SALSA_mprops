See Figure 5 provides a clear explanation of the beta-strand contiguity SALSA computation.
See Figure 6 provides a clear explanation of the alpha-helical amphipathicity SALSA computation.


The beta-strand contiguity and sliding averages idea was first conceived 2002-2003. 
It was originally written in Java and further developed and refined before publication in 2007.

mprops

Early ideas that would eventually lead to mprops algorithm were also conceived in 2002-2003. 
It was developed and refined in close coordination with experimental data in vitro. 
It was published in Journal of Biological Chemistry (2010) 285(49): 38555-38567.
