With regards to the Radzicka & Wolfenden Hydrophilicity scale:
It is important to note that no value was given in the original publication for Proline,
The value was estimated at -3.8 based on comparison to Methionine (Roseman hydrophobicity numbers), but it should
also be noted that there is quite a significant degree of variation between different hydrophobicity
scales.
