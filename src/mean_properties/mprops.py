"""
The derivation of the coefficients for each of the 4 mean properties (mean beta-sheet propensity, mean hydrophilicity, 
mean absolute net charge and mean total charge) is based on the kinetics of fibrillogenesis for recombinant 
synuclein constructs measured in vitro. The calculations are similar to those described in Zibaee et al 2010 JBC
but differ in some important details. 

The combination of the 4 weighted properties into one is referred to as `mprops`. 
The combination of normalised mprops and normalised SALSA b-strand contiguity integrals into one calculation is just 
referred to as the `combined algorithm`. The use of the combined algorithm produces a fit to the lagtimes with an 
Rsquared ("coefficient of determination") of ... (Rsquared of 1.0 is a perfect fit).

Given the stochastic nature of fibrillogenesis, values are likely to be specific, not only to proteins that are 
natively unfolded, and not only to synuclein-sized proteins, but also for the specific experimental conditions of the 
assays as well. Hence I specify these conditions alongside the code and mathematical derivations: 
lagtimes of fibrillogenesis of synuclein constructs was based on experiments under the following conditions: 
- Protein concentration at 400 microMolars in 30 mM MOPs buffer pH 7.2 and 10 microMolar ThT. 
- Incubation at 37degC, shaken at 450 rpm. 
- 10 microlitre samples collect at 5 subsequent time points 4h, 8h, 24h, 48h, 96h. All measurements were performed on 
each sample immediately after collection.
lagtimes were measured from each experiment, as time taken for ThT values to reach the square of their zero
time emission readings at 480nm. The final value is the mean of the lagtimes for each constructs.

A very important caveat is that for certain synuclein constructs for which lagtime data was included, 
which had longer lagtimes, those proteins did not begin to assemble within the 100 hours limit. Hence, 
the data from these experiments was not included. As such their included data indicates these proteins to be more 
fibrillogenic than they actually were taking in to account the non-inclusion of the aforementioned experiments.
